## About
A full-stack React web application built from scratch using Webpack. The back-end consists of a Washington State Hikes API that handles RESTful routes including GET, POST, DELETE and PUT. In addition to the back-end server, this project also includes a front-end interface, where the user can interact with the API.

### Information About the Data
To see where this data is coming from please see the [wta-web-scraper](https://github.com/yoshiohasegawa/wta-scraper) I built to support this API. More specifically, the database in this project is initially seeded with data that was extracted using this web scraper. To see where this web scraper extracts data from, please visit [WTA's Hiking Guide](https://www.wta.org/go-outside/hikes). Finally, to interact with a visual representation of this data please see this [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yoshio.hasegawa/viz/WTA_Hike_Dash/WashingtonStateHikes).

## Getting Started

To get started you will need to install dependencies:
```console
user@machine:~/washington-hikes-api$ npm i 
```

To continue with the following steps, it is imperative that you have environment variables setup:
```console
user@machine:~/washington-hikes-api$ touch .env
```
In the `.env` file you will need to list the following variables:
```bash
DB_USER=<PSQL_USERNAME>
DB_PW=<PSQL_PASSWORD>
DB_NAME=<PSQL_DATABASE>
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
```
*Note: You will need to create a psql database on your local machine before running this project. Feel free to call it whatever you like and initialize it in the `.env` file.*

To run the initial migration that will create the "hikes" table run the following command:
```console
user@machine:~/washington-hikes-api$ npm run migrate
```

In case you have to rollback you can run the following command: 
```console
user@machine:~/washington-hikes-api$ npm run rollback
```

To seed the database with initial Washington hikes data, run the following command:
```console
user@machine:~/washington-hikes-api$ npm run seed
```

Finally, to run the server and interact with the user interface, run the following command:
```console
user@machine:~/washington-hikes-api$ npm run serve
```
*Note: This project will run on `localhost:9000`*

## API Endpoints and Objects
Currently, this project only contains Hike data which can be represented as Hike objects. Please check back for further expansions to the database, API endpoints/routes and available objects.

### Hikes
```GET /washingtonhikes/api/hikes```
- Returns an array of all Hike objects.

```GET /washingtonhikes/api/hikes/:idOrName```
- Provide either the **uuid** or **name** of the Hike desired.  

```POST /washingtonhikes/api/hikes```
- Request body must contain an object with a property **title** at a minimum.

```DELETE /washingtonhikes/api/hikes/:id```
- Provide the **uuid** of the Hike to be deleted.

```PUT /washingtonhikes/api/hikes/:id```
- Provide the **uuid** of the Hike to be updated.  
- Request body must contain valid properties and values for updating.  

### Example Hike Object
```js
{
    id:              "3dde0ded-4c25-46a8-b425-66dbc790ca95",
    title:           "Mailbox Peak",
    region:          "Snoqualmie Region",
    distance:        9.4,
    dist_type:       "roundtrip",
    gain:            4000,
    highest:         4822,
    rating:          4.22,
    rating_count:    89,

    updated_at:      "2021-04-26T09:49:33.943Z"
}
```

## Front-End Interface
Apologies in advance for it being very bland ðŸ˜…, it gets the job done I guess. The front-end interface allows for the user to simply test `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, and `PUT` requests sent to the back-end API.  
- **_Warning: This will alter your database!_**
